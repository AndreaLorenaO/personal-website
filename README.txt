Personal Website – Lorena Odino

This website is **based on the "Dimension" template by HTML5 UP** (html5up.net | @ajlkn), 
which is free for personal and commercial use under the CCA 3.0 license (html5up.net/license).

While the original layout and styling from Dimension were used as a starting point, 
significant **custom design decisions** were made to improve the **user experience** and the 
way content is explored. This includes layout adjustments, navigation enhancements, and visual 
refinements to better showcase projects and information.
